      "Texto UNO [\"One of my favorite places - great coffee, food, and bar.  The staff here is the best - always pleasant and they know their customers.  If you work in the CBD, I recommend this as your morning coffee stop.  The lunch menu is excellent and the prices are very reasonable.  After work is the perfect time to hit the rooftop bar - happy hour and daily drink specials abound.  I've been coming here since they opened in April - highly recommend it!\", 'Great location and the rooftop lounge area of the hotel is beautiful, but the service killed the experience. The bartender took a while to make two drinks, and even though she was lacking a key ingredient to make them, she handed us the drinks and explained she \"made it work\". The drinks were bitter and very hard to drink. She then charged us a different price than what was in their menu, and acted as if she was doing us a favor by giving us correct change. Lastly, when we asked her for a wifi password, she smugly gave us the wrong password, which we had to ask another employee for.', \"Very cool spot regardless if you're inside at the Pisco Bar or enjoying the scenery from the rooftop.\\nExcellent happy hour, daily specials. Tristan was our bartender both times and was so attentive and made a damn good cocktail.\\nHighly recommend, especially since Pisco isn't something I've really seen around the city.\", \"Service with a smile was on point and the conversation with the people was lovely! Super friendly and gave some great recommendations to try as this is our first time to New Orleans. Personal touch on the drinks as well as the coffee. Looking for a great 'mule', Chilano is the drink to get.\", 'Yelp, this was a joke. Almost none of the menu exists. No table service and prices, for the existing menu are a joke.', \"Attached to Cata Houla Hotel. Environment is twin: one is Bar side the other is upstairs deck.  Pisco sour is real, no short cuts and they have a full bar. Lomo Saltado was as a sandwich with a salad- both were very good or excellent if you like Peruvian spices, And for the area inexpensive. Cool plate that was a heavy piece of polished stone. Service was very good and bar tender was a listener. Public parking nearby. I'll be back! But earlier.\", 'Truly a beautiful place to get incredible drinks that are better than fairly priced. \\n\\nHowever the pièce de resistance is the incredible bartender Lydia who serves quickly and beautifully. Moreover, she is wonderful to talk to and has a fantastic energy that has truly made me feel at home. Coming back for many more drinks!', \"Rude ass staff haven't been here 20mins and they attitudes are horrible. This is a fairly new hotel it will make 1 yr this April. Just the greeting from them especially the workers at the bar was horrible !! So horrible we're cancelling and moving hotels I won't tolerate shitty attitudes from nowhere where I'm paying my money! I also ordered food from the bar fries and a burger. They said they didn't have any ketchup. Then the guy proceeds to a table in the area and scoops me up some ketchup that has been sitting there. I asked could I have something that hasn't been sitting out. He said no we don't have any. So why would u give me some ketchup that's been sitting out in a cup on a table all day. So unsanitary and rude. It was disgusting the way this guy talked to me! I will never recommend this place to anyone. the lady that checked us in was friendly however but not the bar staff or waiters! Seems as if they hate their job!\", 'Located in the back of the Catahoula hotel I thought I had found a hidden gem.  It is very hard to find and has a cool rooftop setting.  These are the only two good or resounding points of this place.  The bar tender was a super rude girl who obviously had no interest in being there.  The drink prices were a bit high even at happy hour for the quality of the beverages.  And to top it off had to correct the bar tender on her math for the bill.  Definitely not the hidden gem I had hoped for.  Go somewhere else!', \"Cool cafe spot to do work or relax. I didn't feel like I was in New Orleans... It felt like I was in a cafe in Hoboken or in the city. I came here with the intent of eating ceviche (couldn't find any other spot around!) but was told kitchen open up at 4pm. Merp. That was a fail. The espresso here is great, though!\", 'Perfect stop while you are bar hopping in the quarter. Great drinks and bartenders,could have stayed all night!', \"From start to finish, I was wowed. Spicy corn guacamole, sweet potato bisque, hearty, loaded avocado sandwich... all delicious, unique and packed with bold flavors. The service was impeccable, and I appreciated how attentive the service was without being intrusive during our large group dinner. Their dinner menu consists of lighter fare, and the prices are moderate for a great delicious dinner in a beautiful courtyard setting. I'd recommend for an intimate dinner or date night, as it's a cozy neighborhood restaurant that will impress.\", \"What a beautiful way to make use of gorgeous old structures. Amazing architectural resourcefulness of using multiple buildings to create a hotel and a cafe/bar with a unique indoor/outdoor blend.\\n\\nEnjoyed a mixed drink at the rooftop bar, but ducked inside so that we wouldn't interrupt the film viewing put together on the rooftop (popcorn and jambalaya inclusive!). \\n\\nTapas-style dinner downstairs in the cafe was fun, super gourmet/tasty, and visually appealing. Our bartender Travis was helpful in helping us choose the plates and even designed a drink for us with his unique touch. \\n\\nIt's the whole package. I'm planning to stay at this hotel next time I'm in town.\", \"Great varieties of Pisco in an eclectic atmosphere. Nice service and beautiful rooftop. Perfect for groups and have a great time. I'm Peruvian and was impressed with their Pisco selections!\", 'Nasty service behind the bar especially the girl named chelsea. The chef was friendly but the lomo saltado was overcooked, the bread was stale, and the ceviche was disappointing. Time for the hotel to reboot and clear out most of the staff.', \"Tiki bars are my calling according to my husband!? I don't mind a good cocktail and an umbrella once in a while to make myself feel better so I won't argue him.  Even though I want to roll my eyes everytime.\\n\\nThe drinks here are very personalized and the vibe is definitely a bit more lounge than tiki.  Had a few with the girls and it was a great time.  Our drinks were strong and definitely not the typical sugary beverage.  I had the ALGARROBINA - a creamy drink made with sap from algarrobina tree pods which also contained raw egg yolk.  Tart, sweet, bitters and a unique creamy texture from the egg.  All to make for a interesting cocktail.  \\n\\nThe Service is great and the outdoors is a nice touch.\", \"Perfect cocktails, reviving espresso and basically everything is made in house. We didn't eat here, but stopped in for drinks mid-afternoon. The Pisco Sour is as good as any you'll find in Peru, the orange juice freshly squeezed and the coffee will bring you back to life. \\n\\nKeep it classy and add this place to your trip\", \"Great location, terrible service. Staying at the hotel, so I made my way into the bar twice. The first day it took about 20 minutes to get a drink. The bar was anything but busy, and the bartender could not care less about his customers. I figured it was an off day, things happen. Went back again our second night and it was even worse. Sat at the bar for ten to fifteen minutes as the bartender (bleached blonde hair male with tattoos) completely ignored me. It was so bad that the locals next to me tried to order me a drink. When I asked for his attention politely, he said he'd get to me rudely. I walked out. Don't bother with this place. Plenty better locations in this great city.\", \"We were staying at the Holiday Inn around the corner from this place and I LOVE pisco so we definitely wanted to check it out. The drinks are on point, well priced, and the ambiance is amazing. You can sit inside or outside, and the staff definitely knows how to balance attention to you and leaving you alone. \\n\\nOne of the best parts of this place is the vegan pop-up, Midnight Noodle, that was there (and I believe I heard them say it is there every Friday! We tried the scallion pancake and the mock pork dumplings. The pancake was amazing! The dumplings were great, but the sauce was the best part rather than the filling. \\n\\nCertainly check this place out if you're visiting and want something slightly more relaxed than the hustle and bustle of Bourbon Street.\", \"We didn't try the food but the cocktails were unbelievable. The bartenders were extremely knowledgeable and friendly. I was super impressed with the quality of the drinks and the info on pisco\", \"Stopped by while my bf and I were in town for a conference in October, being from the northeast I wanted to take advantage of something we don't have too often... a sunny rooftop bar. So funny thing is we never made it to the rooftop, because we ended up sitting at the downstairs bar and it was too good to leave. The cocktails are amazingly crafted and the bar staff were great to watch as they crafted drinks and chat with. It's an intimate space but never felt crowded. After exploring the  bar/restaurant scene for a few days and not finding a better cocktail around we even came back a second night (still didn't make it to the roof!). We were treated to an impromptu piano performance by another one of the patrons that night. The piano sits in the entry/hall between the hotel reception area and the bar. The back leads out to an open courtyard that the guest rooms open on to; too bad we didn't know about the hotel before or we definitely would have stayed.\", \"Bartender was very attentive only reason why 4 rather than 5 was the upstairs bar was not open. We didn't have an opportunity to try the food, but definitely will return.\", 'A group of about six of us stopped into this bar for a drink on New Year\\'s Day simply because it was the closest bar to Clue Carre. I didn\\'t expect anything special from it, but boy, were we in for a surprise! But I\\'ll skip the anecdote and get right to the breakdown:\\n\\nTHE GOOD:\\n+ Creativity- this bar should get 5 stars alone for their creative cocktail combinations! I\\'m sure you can get your \"usual\" here, but don\\'t! Try something new- order off their menu, and you\\'ll be delighted. In our medium-sized group, each person got a drink nobody else had ever tried before... so we all got to try six new drinks!\\n+ Presentation- not only have they mastered new flavor, but the folks here go out of their way to present the drink with some... pizzazz! (not to be confused with pizza. Thanks autocorrect.)\\n+ Service- I cannot speak to what the service is like on a busy Saturday night, but on our trip, the gals behind the bar were friendly, vivacious, and happy to answer any menu questions we had. \\n\\nTHE BAD: \\n- Not a lot of big tables for big groups (I didn\\'t actually have anything bad to put here.)\\n\\nTHE UGLY:\\nNo ugly here!\\n\\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\\nGet the \"Coolest Kid in the Class\" Cocktail ... I won\\'t ruin the surprise of why it\\'s awesome, but it\\'s awesome. Order it. Trust me.', \"You come in and the bar is very unsuspecting, tucked in a cute corner with vintage charm. You'll see a sign for Midnight Noodle before you get into the bar. I really appreciate the Peruvian drinks, although they aren't the best pisco sours I ever had, they did a pretty good job. There are a lot of places to sit while still being a cute, intimate bar: the outdoor courtyard, the bar, the hotel lobby, and some cute tables. Overall, a nice find for a couple Peruvian cocktails.\", 'This bar was absolutely wonderful.  The bartenders, Lydia and Adrian (Adrien/Adrienne?), were so friendly and were bursting with knowledge and fun facts about their liquors.  My friends and I killed nearly 2 hours there and they flew right by.  I do not drink, but Lydia made me 2 non-alcoholic drinks without me even asking.  What an absolute gem of a human being.  My friends loved their drinks and we would all recommend this bar without hesitation.  We will 100% be back.', \"So many hotel bars are soulless... just a spot to unwind after a rough day of travel. Not this one. It's so frigging cute! \\n\\nIt's small space but that just makes it cozy. It has vintage charm for days. Plus if the light/weather is right, the patio is perfect and lots of folks were wandering out to take selfies in front of exposed brick walls.\\n\\nThe bartenders were solid and the bubbles were cold. Plus there's a pop up for snacks and you can pay for that at the bar. Definitely a spot I'd pop into again.\", 'Absolutely fantastic. By happenstance, stumbled upon Pisco after a recent menu change - drinks were great! The Card from Karen was a favorite of our group. And the pop-up brunch on Sunday by Kinoko was one of the best meals I had while visiting New Orleans.', 'Rude.\\nOk so you dont open for 45 minutes, what is the reason to state to a group of locals not only that fact but that your from Florida and \"hate\" New Orleans(?) all in one minute! we will spread the word for you, got it', 'I wanted to really like this place for a lot of reasons BUT, my experience was less than favorable.\\n\\nThey are very short staffed behind the bar. I waited over 15 minutes for a drink and then they didn\\'t even have what I ordered :(\\n\\nI ordered a different drink, but in the process of her making it, she dropped the bottle of rum and we were all hit with little shards of glass and covered in rum. My drink then had to be substituted again, and I wasn\\'t a fan.\\n\\nAnother woman and I both told the gentleman that was cleaning the broken bottle that pieces of broken glass flew into the ice container... he simply said \"it\\'ll be okay\" and ignored it. I switched to a beer after that, not wanting to risk it.\\n\\nMy food was served-but not exactly to me. It was placed on the bar somewhat close to me and after a few minutes of no one saying anything, I just assumed it was mine. I waited another few minutes for silverware until I finally just got up to get it myself. No one asked how my food was.\\n\\nThe bartender was veryyy sweet and she did give me a discount on the bill, but they just need more help behind the bar... So many people were waiting for things. It was too busy for just one person. I felt bad for her. Through everything, she kept a smile on her face and held her composure. Honestly, I even feel bad writing this because of how sweet she was.\\n\\nKudos to the bartender\\n\\nSuggestion to the establishment: you need to be better staffed\\n\\nAnd finally, a warning to the man who cleaned the broken glass: ignoring 2 customer\\'s concern about a possible hazard is a liability waiting to happen.', \"This place is a hidden gem, which is why it took me so long to write this review. But, I decided that I should share this deliciousness with you. I'm sorry to say that they have since altered the menu, but I'm sure everything on it now is phenomenal as well!\\n\\nI was blown away by every single bite I put into my mouth. My favorites were the spicy stuffed buna and Mardi Gras dumplings. I'm not even ashamed that I dream about them sometimes...\\n\\nSpicy Stuffed Buns: filed with glass noodles, shiitake mushrooms, spinach, and ginger. Topped with house chili oil and sweet soy vinegar\\nNight Market Dumplings: filled with cabbage, shiitake, carrot, zucchini, and tofu\\nPickled Bok Choy: pickled with ginger, garlic, and Thai chili\\nMardi Gras Dumplings: filled with yams, cabbage, and scallions. Served with yellow curry sauce\\n\\nY'all need to check out this place in the Catahoula Hotel! I'd give 10 stars if I could.\", 'I\\'m giving this bar 1 star for not doing anything to correct the wrong information in yelp. The reviews and the pictures show a Peruvian menu that doesn\\'t exist, the barman told us they stop serving food a year ago and now is just a bar that serves like 4 or 5 kinds of appetizers none of them Peruvian. The drinks were decent but the service or the place weren\\'t . Having just a barman and no more service in the room doesn\\'t exactly say that they care for customers.\\nHi Chelsea thank you for answering... it shows that you care, when we went in there was no one to great us or sit us so we asked the barman if we could sit and he said yes you can but anyways you need to get up and order at the bar .... so we sat at he bar and asked for the food menu and he said \"this is not a restaurant this is a bar that serves some appetizers \" 2 more parties came in while I was there asking for the menu too we were all tourists and he said the same you can sit no one else would take your order so ppl had to get up to pick their menu and do the order and come back.... that didn\\'t seem like the best way to offer service....', \"Piscobar has a really unique vibe! The happy hour 50cent dumplings were absolutely delicious and came out of the kitchen hot and fresh!! The drinks were all refreshing and reasonably priced. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because it was very hot inside. I wish the AC worked a little better or there were some fans, however the food and rink made up for it!\", 'Delicious small plates and priced right! We devoured everything! Would recommend to anyone looking for a quiet lowkey night with great cocktails and a nice vibe.', 'Came on Sunday when the kitchen was closed and had food from a popcart.\\n\\nThe bartender was great and the pzt or pyt was mind-blowing ( tequila, coconut cream, pandan,   blue Curacao). Just amazing!\\nOther cocktails were good too and the food from the push cart was amazing as well', \"Amazing bartenders and great vegan food. We loved the dumplings! Get both the sweet potato and nighthawk, they offer different flavors and textures. The mushroom toast texture is great. We didn't get to try the curry or noodles, but we'll be back!\", \"Small bar that's tucked away and great potential to be your next go to place. Small food menu that is all vegetarian. Don't fret if you aren't vegetarian. The food is delicious and will impress the mightiest of carnivores.\", \"Quaint little bar in the Catahoula hotel that specializes in Pisco and craft cocktails. If you don't know which drink you'd like to have, just ask Sean for a recommendation. He's the best! \\n\\nAlso don't miss their happy hour specials including their vegan dumplings! I'm not vegan but the food they serve here is bomb!!! \\n\\nYou can't go wrong with the cocktails, food or service!\", 'Our trip to the Piscobar was pretty good! Unfortunately, they were sold out of a few items by the time we arrived. We happened to be there for happy hour and dumplings were only $0.50. The dumplings were absolutely delicious. We also ordered a mushroom toast and a few drinks. Overall the food was good, bartenders were friendly and fast. All food is plant based and reasonably priced.', 'Ate here last night with a friend, and we ordered everything on the menu, except the mardi gras buns. It was delicious. Each dish was delicious and unique, spicey, fresh and hot. Service was delightful. Bartender was friendly and helpful.\\n\\nAs we were readying to leave, i touched the shoulder of the young woman who had served our food and whispered that while the food and service was exceptional, the restroom needed attention. She thanked me sincerely and went right to take care of it. She came back as we were heading out to thank me again, saying that she was the owner, and she appreciated me letting her know about the loo.\\n\\nCannot wait to go back.', \"Piscobar is nestled within the friendly confines of The Catahoula Boutique Hotel and I absolutely loved it! If I lived in New Orleans, I'd be here a lot. Service was great and there's just a really cool vibe throughout. I recommend exploring the grounds and the various spaces the hotel offers, including the roof top area. In fact, my brother stayed at this boutique hotel for a few nights and loved it.\\n\\nAs for liquid consumables, we started with coffee and finished with cocktails. Their espresso was tasty and the pull was excellent; the tranquil environment enhanced it even more. For cocktails I had to try their Pisco Sour. I must admit, I got completely spoiled by the many Pisco Sours I had in Lima, Peru last year. None I've had before or since have even come close to measuring up to the ones there. I mean, it's not even close. While the Pisco Sour here doesn't measure up either, when comparing it with others that I've had outside of Peru this would be the best one. I also tasted their Desiigner (with an extra i) cocktail which consists of Pisco, Pineapple, Coconut, Pandan, Blanc Vermouth. It was great. I'm a Pandan fan and it worked perfectly with the other ingredients making for a tasty and refreshing cocktail.\\n\\nOur barista/bartender was super nice and I wish I had more time here to explore their drink options further, including their coffee cocktails, but unfortunately I did not. This bar and the Catahoula hotel are gems definitely worth stopping by.\", 'I love novelty in my food (and in my cocktails), and this place struck gold on both counts.', \"I was super excited to try this place but somewhat disappointed after our experience .  The night hawk dumplings and the sweet potato dumplings were delicious but looks like they were thrown on the plate. It also took over 30 minutes to come from the kitchen.  We were almost late for our play.  They were out of the noodle plate (again).  We got the chickpea curry which was so spicy it was inedible.  Don't know if it was an off night or maybe new kitchen staff.\", 'The service here is not good at all, which is unfortunate considering the food was ok. Not great. Ok. Drinks are unique and give the place a lot of potential. Unfortunately the service negatively l outshines everything else. Choose someplace else.', \"I loved that I got (I think it was the pisco punch). And I had a taste of the pisco sour which I also thought was yummy. \\n\\nIt was a little odd because the menus were not updated and some things on the menu were out. \\n\\nI liked the environment and LOVED the rooftop!! I'd come back just for the rooftop.\", \"We stopped here for drinks. It's a small bar in a boutique hotel. The drinks were good (hence 3 stars) but the service was not so great, it seemed the bartender had friends of regulars because she took a bit to check on us and the couple that sat next to us (after we arrived). Again, drinks were great if you love Pisco (I do ) but don't expect great service.\", \"I really enjoyed this place! First of all, the dumplings, especially the sweet potato ones, are excellent. I am sorry I wasn't able to have the noodle dish but I was told that is a must-have. Next time! I love how this place only serves vegan food! THANK YOU!\\n\\nThe bartender, Kieran, was also a good conversationalist and made great cocktails, many of them off menu. I highly recommend this place and will be back when I return to New Orleans!\", 'Was looking for a place to eat with a friend visiting from out of town who is vegetarian. Google led me to this place and the menu and pictures online looked delicious. I am a sucker for Yucca so when I saw it advertised, I had to check it out. \\n\\nThe place itself is beautiful. There is a small outside patio which is inviting and quaint. We shared the space with a lizard, who was spent the late afternoon sunning himself on the window frame. The bartender was friendly and came out side and wiped down the seats, which had become wet during the afternoon shower. But oddly enough, never came back outside to bring us menus or ask if we needed anything. Several staff members past us too. Perhaps they thought we were already being waited on. \\n\\nAfter we retrieved menus from the bartender ourselves, I was disappointed to find out the menu didn\\'t match what was advertised online. There are 14 different pictures of food on the website and not one of them is on the menu. The hours of operation are also wrong. \\n\\nI went inside to place our order and inquired about the menu difference. She told me that the menu had changed \"awhile ago\". She said many people have questioned the menu and corporate has been notified but \"refuse to make changes to the website.\"\\n\\nRegardless, we ordered food and the rest of the stay was good. The food arrived promptly and the drinks were brought to us swiftly. We ordered the Ceviche Del Dia, Patatas Bravas en Salsa Criolla, and the Pimientos Rellenos. The food was tasty. Fair warning, the Rellenos isn\\'t spicy per se, but there are pieces in there that offers quite the kick. I found the hot pepper piece and half my tongue started going numb! \\n\\nI found it interesting that their weekly special dishes consisted of 5 items, of which 4 of them were desserts. LOL\\n\\nLearning the corporate office doesn\\'t update their website makes me wonder else they aren\\'t handling.\\n\\nThere is a bar atop the hotel too but I didn\\'t wander up there. If you are looking for a cute place for a small bite to eat, in a memorable setting, this is it. I wasn\\'t blown away by the food but I would definitely try this place again.', 'Looking for close by vegan options when staying in New Orleans, we went to Piscobar.  The place was cool, nice ambiance.  Bar tender was great.  We ordered his special drinks (porch light?  I forget) and they were great...went back for another round.  The star of the dinner was the dumplings.  They were also on happy hour special at 50 cents each so we ordered a ton of them.  Tasty!', \"I was so happy to finally visit when they were open. I usually find my way there a little late and I believe they close at 12 am. The wanderer was an amazing cocktail and recommendation by the bartender. But if the cocktail didn't please you the bartenders Jesse and Wade (I believe that's his name) sure will. They were super pleasant and made me feel so welcome. The space at the hotel is already warm and inviting and those two made me feel as though I was a regular. I tried their vegan version of pork dumplings and they were delicious. If you want to get some fresh air head up to the roof top bar it's a nice space with a decent view.\", \"For as unsold as I am on the hotel, the restaurant is a whole different story. Wow! In a city that prides itself on delicious food no matter where you go, the Catahoula Cafe stands tall/proud in the crowd.\\n\\nFirst off, this is a pisco bar which means you're going to get very drunk and enjoy every sip as you do so. There's not a lot I miss about living in Miami but my new city's lack of Peruvian options does get me a little down. I was happy to get reacquainted with a favored spirit here. And, boy, did I. I began my menu exploration with the Chinguertio. I couldn't pronounce it, but you better believe I pronounced every drop of pisco, cinnamon, muddled grapes, and lime that were in the cocktail.* The Chinguertio turned to a Chilcano Granada (passionfruit, pomegranate, pisco, and ginger beer). A Chilcano Granada turned into a Pisco Punch. A Pisco Punch turned back into a Chinguertio... which turned into red wine... which, eventually, turned into a Little Black Star (rum, luxardo liqueur, lime, orange curacao, and coffee syrup) -- to wake me up.**\\n\\nWith such a developed cocktail program, you might imagine the Catahoula would rely solely on the libations. Nope! The food program pairs well with the drinks (which are the admitted stars of the show). Don't come expecting high-end, full-on plates. These are elevated bar selections that help you drink more pisco. I started with some of the most addicting guacamole I've ever had. To soak up*** my drinks, I decided on the Peruvian Palta Rellena (a stuffed avocado shrimp salad) and seasoned fries topped with equally seasoned pulled pork. No, not the most innovative of cuisine... Yes, it's delicious and will keep you upright after downing your body weight in pisco.\\n\\nI wouldn't stay at the hotel again, but I'd pop in for a drink and snack any time. Props to Catahoula for serving up Peruvian fare in such a magically delicious way. New Orleans, you're full of surprises.\\n\\n*Well, slurred.\\n** I will not be judged.\\n*** Valiant effort.\", 'I will not be back to this place. The bartender openly, rudely, and aggressively stated that he hates New Orleans to a group of locals. Needless to say, all 10 of us walked out without spending a dollar. Absolutely disgusted by his behavior.', 'I absolutely love this bar! Even though I live in New Orleans, I stayed at the Catahoula last year for a work conference and my team happily convened morning, noon and night here. Delicious coffee drinks in the morning, lovely evening wines and cocktails early evening, and not gonna lie, we might have closed the bar down at least twice when night caps turned into, \"Oh shit, we have to get up bright and early\" (starting the day bright and early was almost a cheerful affair because it meant sipping espresso drinks surrounded by such urbane tropical environs!)\\n\\nThat courtyard is a magical place. It\\'s an Instagram paradise, with a 3 story mural, Edison bulb lighting, plenty of tables for you to enjoy your drink and pretend that you\\'re in Latin America. I visited the other evening for some Midnight Noodle (vegan Taiwanese pop-up) and although it was a slower night than usual, no one strolling in could resist the vibe and ended up staying a while. This, even with the lure of the rooftop bar above (separate review).\\n\\nI\\'m not sure of the name of the bartender working this past Saturday evening, but I really just adore her! She extremely nice and engaging and pours her cocktails with supreme care... I stuck to Cava the other night and it was served up cold and bubbly. \\n\\nYou have to appreciate this oasis at the edge of the CBD. I can\\'t say that there\\'s a ton of hotel bars where I\\'d choose to become a regular, but this is surely one of them.', \"Walked in and thought it was a nice bar but then went to the bar to get a drink and was told they weren't open for a few minutes and also he hates New Orleans what a disappointment and a waste if a representative for a new Orleans Establishment.\", \"I've lived around the corner for two months now and have never heard of this place! I am super stoked to have randomly stumbled upon it because I can see this being a go to spot for me. \\n\\nThe cocktail menu is a decent size and they also serve beer and wine. I went with a rum based cocktail with hibiscus, lime & mint (unsure of the actual name). The cocktails are around $12 but I feel that is fair. \\n\\nAfter searching this place up after the fact, turns out they have a plant based menu! Whenever I've searched for this type food on Yelp this place doesn't come up which is why I think it's such a hidden gem. Absolutely will be back to try their food & I will report back!\", \"Waites is a phenomenal bartender! I'm sorry to my Madigans loves, but his technique is impeccable! We had a function for my program at the bar and I fell in love with the chilcano, a Peruvian version of a Moscow mule, but with pisco! Unique, sweet, and his little trick with the mint gave it such a nice scent and added a tiny hint of mint to make it the perfect little drink! Also tried the Incan 75 and the D'artagnan, a Pisco martini! This pisco is such a unique earthy sweet flavor... Might just be my new favorite alcohol!\\nAlso, Waites handled our party of 15 people with ease, was super polite and courteous, and was incredibly knowledgeable about his techniques and the type of alcohol used... I learned so much! It's definitely a nice treat to get a drink and a history/knowledge lesson! I hate parking downtown, but will definitely be back for this!\", \"Piscobar is an awesome spot to grab some beautiful drinks or chill with friends. You can sit inside at the bar, in the hotel lobby, in a beautiful courtyard, or UP ON THE ROOFTOP! Make sure you get there early on the weekends because their famous happy-hour dumplings always sell out, and you definitely won't want to miss them.\\n\\nPisco is a peruvian spirit made from grapes and was first created in the 16th century. If you have never had it before, I would highly recommend getting a Pisco Punch or Pisco Sour to truly appreciate this unique liquer.\\n\\nThis place has friendly bartenders, an amazing ambiance, and great drinks. You should definitely stop by and grab a drink (or two).\"]\n"

Also it's open on Mondays at lunch which seems rare in this area.\", 'We had a wonderful meal no one was disappointed. I had the gnocchi with sausage and mushrooms itvwas fabulous. Our waiter Jabar was superb , thank you for your wonderful service. We will be back !', 'We will be Back!\\nHad dinner with 3 other couples. Table-side\\nBronzino, beautiful pasta dishes, terrific apps and drinks. So nice inside. Welcome\\nTo the neighborhood ! Heading back tonight', 'Amazing first impression! My girlfriend and I tried out La fava for the first time last night and we were very impressed. This is a restaurant glen mills needed. Specialty cocktails were some of the best we ever had. High quality ingredients/Alcohol for a fairly good price. Wine list is a little limited but it just opened so expect it to expand. Most importantly the staff/food stole the show. Must try if you are in the area!', 'We went here last minute based on open table opening.  Sooo happy we did. We sat at a table near the bar.  If you are looking for a nice bar, this is the place to go.  The food was amazing.  This is a father son business, the chef is from Italy.......need I say more.  The grilled octopus was so tender. We also had clams, the seafood pasta.  We could not have been more satisfied! We will definitely be back.  Please try this restaurant!', 'Amazing evening in a fine neighborhood restaurant where you saw friends and felt at home. The owner has a great pedigree in the business. The place has the potential to fill the void of the Blue Pear as local mainstay. Oh did I mention the splendid menu was well executed and the wines well selected. A tribute to the memory of my friend and Delaware County restrantur Jerry Ianucci.', 'Very good Mediterranean restaurant from their daily specials like seafood rissotto, appetizers like fritto  misto, daily soups like tuscan bean soup, pasta like vegetable lasagna and main  chicken, pork, beef and seafood dishes', 'Simply stated, there is no reason to pay $25 for chicken parmason (how do you spell that) when there are so many other good Italian restaurants in the area. Everything is wxpensive', \"This place is new to the area and is a great addition. The owner is friendly and welcoming and his dad is a treat! The food was awesome (especially if you like garlic!)... the fava bean hummus is a tasty start. We had the clams casino- like appetizer which was flavorful and the scallop/ pasta special. The bananas foster flambé tableside made by the owners dad was delicious! Although it's a bit loud the atmosphere is nice and the do do their best not to sit everyone on top of each other. Rachael our server was attentive and friendly. We will definitely be back! I wish them much success.\", 'This is a great new local place. A little hard to find...not their fault!! Township needs to support local businesses!! The food is top notch!! Drinks are innovative & interesting...and across the board delicious!! They have a great wine list. We did apps & drinks...the charcuterie board is a meal!! All you need!! But the top seller for us was the incredibly attentive, knowledgeable and super outgoing staff! Stop in!! They are worth the drive!! You will learn about wine, talk some sports and learn about the restaurant business all while enjoying a fabulous meal and expertly crafted drinks!! Should actually be a 5 stars...but we only had appetizers...so when we come back...maybe tomorrow!...expect a 5 star review!!', 'This is a gem. Relaxed long lunch. Servers were attentive but not intrusive. Friendly and helpful with menu and wines. Top notch table clearing standards. Impressive wine list with good selections by the glass and carefully curated international and US wines by bottle. The cava rose brut went well with the melon and prosciutto app. Great presentation of the fresh melon, prosciutto, figs and pecorino Romano. Fava bean dip for the hot fresh bread was very nice. The savory mussels were a treat with a yummy red broth. Enjoyed the brown butter cauliflower with white raisin surprise. For dessert the delicate cannoli and an espresso martini was the perfect end to the meal. Nice room. Bar looks inviting, especially for happy hour which we will definitely try. Only demerit was the gritty sand in mussels. We prefer them to be soaked longer to remove it totally but understand some do not object to the grit.', 'We will be Back!\\nHad dinner with 3 other couples. Table-side\\nBronzino, beautiful pasta dishes, terrific apps and drinks. So nice inside Welcome\\nTo the neighborhood ! Made a 7:15 reservation for 8 and was seated promptly. Food stayed consistently good. Lot of people dining. Place will be very successful as food is terrific.', \"La Fava restaurant was a fantastic eating experience. I have not had Italian food this good since my grandmothers passing. Old world rustic Sauces with Homemade Pastas. This has to be the BEST Italian eatery in this area, far surpassing any philadelphia establishment. The waiter was a seasoned professional, service slightly slow, but understandable since it's a new opening.  This was exceptional Italian food.\", 'Amazing food, great staff.  Me and my fiancé are professional eaters, jokingly but we eat out 10 times a month and this place was amazing.  Must go', \"Love this place! I have never been to a happy hour that had such a great menu! Something for everyone!\\n Prices are the best and the food was delicious!\\nNow let's talk about the staff! Top notch! Bartender John did great, and our server Jen was absolutely amazing! We were a really big crowd and I never felt like I had to wait long for anything! \\nWe will be back!! Thanks for the vegan options\", 'Very tasty, went here for date night and was not disappointed! I had a steak, my husband had the veal. Mine was juicy and tender, veal was great and the mashed potatoes were excellent! Highly recommend!', 'Exceptional food and service! Great atmosphere too! Nice place for a date or special occasion!', 'My friend and I had lunch here today. We both chose the lunch buffet and were thoroughly impressed. The buffet offered  two pastas, salmon, chicken parmesan, soup, salad, bread, sautéed veggies, rice, and antipasto. After we had our fill, we then had cannolis and brownie cheesecake for dessert. The food was delicious, the staff was attentive, the atmosphere was relaxed and we got all this for only $15 per person. The buffet changes daily, and I am looking forward to my next visit.', \"La Fava Restaurant & Bar was such an amazing experience. The service is impeccable and the food left me speechless. Such a great restaurant totally recommend if you're by the area.\", \"They offer a lunch buffet for under $15. My husband went with the buffet and I opted for the meat & cheese platters. \\n\\nI was extremely surprised by how good the chicken was during for a lunch buffet. My husband raved about hOw moist and flavorful it was, so I asked for a bite. Normally, I'm not a fan of buffet style foods because I find them to be overcooked and stale, but this wasn't the case at all. \\n\\nI do wish they offered a combo of meat and cheese instead of just one or the other. They were both around $17 EACH. You should of seen my face when I saw the boards coming out. Way too much food for one person. Each board was stacked pretty high with meat or cheese. One board is easily enough for 4 people to share. \\n\\nThe inside of the restaurant is beautiful. They have a nice glass wine cellar in the back that you can see into. They also have a banquet hall, which was full of people when we walked in. I would have preferred if they closed the doors while people were in there. I sat through most of my lunch overhearing the entire thing and I was on the complete opposite side of the restaurant. \\n\\nService was kinda slow for empty they were. Then again, they did have a large party in the banquet hall, so that could have been the reason why. \\n\\nI did see that they offered a happy hour in the evenings. \\n\\nOverall, I would come back to try their different menu items.\", 'Our first time stopping into this well setup restaurant. Unfortunately we did not realize how popular the spot was and needed a reservation. Luckily the host mentioned taking a table of 4 who sat at the bar. We ended up bar side and ordered a delicious meal without an issue. Bar was a little crowded to eat but we had a great time. I look forward to going back with a reservation next visit.', 'Front of the house had some issues, had reservations yet the host sat several people that did not.  The food is great and the owner made the reservation issue right.', 'Really love this hidden gem. Rachel is the best - and the staff in general is awesome.  Wine menu is awesome and the staff are all super knowledgeable. Spinach gnocchi out of this world.', 'Went for lunch  and got the buffet for $14/$15. Pretty good food. Would try again with regular menu selections. Service was great.', \"It was just ok; probably won't go back. We were seated promptly, and ordered apps, entrees, and a bottle of wine. The apps came out fairly quickly but were tiny. The entrees took close to two hours to come out. We were starving. The entrees themselves were fine but not really authentic Italian. And despite the server apologizing for the wait, nothing was offered in compensation. She could have comped a dessert, or brought an appetizer Over to make up for the ridiculous wait.\", \"Just had the luncheon buffet here today.  The salad/antipasto bar was fresh and delicious!  The pasta dishes were very tasty and our server Jennifer was such a delight.  Don't forget to get a Cappuccino!  Will gladly come again!\", \"I've been to La Fava at least ten times since it opened a year ago. As a matter of fact, I had dinner at the bar on the very first night of business. I've had lunch, brunch and dinner.  Each time was a little different, not perfect, but worth coming back again. The food is really very good. Fresh, flavorful, bountiful and presented well. The ambiance is cozy and elegant, with romantic booths. The restaurant business can be challenging because it's a people business. So let's just say that they are still working out the kinks with servers, bartenders, and the kitchen staff. Again, it's only been a year, and I believe they are learning a lot as they go (and grow). One of the best things about La Fava is that it is a locally owned business. The owners are a family, and as a customer in their restaurant, you feel like they actually care about you and your dining experience. Last night, Christmas Eve, was a true example of the care that the owner, Michael, shows to his customers. We didn't have the perfect experience at dinner, it was a very very busy night and our table of 10 hit several snags throughout the dinner. Micheal totally owned the missteps and was gracious, thoughtful and kind in his willingness to make things right. We will continue to come back to La Fava. The food is extremely good, the atmosphere is warm and elegant, and the sincere and honest care the owners have for their customers is something you can't find in most businesses today. La Fava is a diamond in the rough, and I recommend you give them a try.\", 'We really wanted to like the place, we have been dying to try it and have heard many great things. I also wanted to reserve a bubble for a party of ten at the end of the month for a friend\\'s birthday. We go out to dinner probably 2-3 times a month and love ordering different food to try each time. There were four of us dining, my husband, son, daughter and I. We were celebrating my birthday and a friend of mine who owns a local salon suggested we try it. (Unbeknownst to us, she called earlier in the day to pay our bill ahead of time as she was so excited for us to try it as well). We came in at 6:30 and it was pretty busy but not jammed packed and the bubbles were not all filled. Jackson was our waiter and he didn\\'t make us feel very welcome. He told us a few times how he was triple sat and it was going to take awhile for everything. I was a waitress in college and you never let your customers know that you\\'re in the weeds or having a bad night. We waited a long time for any water, our drink orders (martini, Prosecco and two sodas) or any bread. So we decided once he came back to put our full order in. We usually love to order a couple apps, salads, entrees, drinks and desserts when we go out. We ordered the fried artichoke and the Tuna Tartare. As I put my order in I also ordered a fired goat cheese salad and then  a Cesar salad for the table which Jackson argued was a \"big salad and did I want that aaaand the Veal Piccata?\" He argued that it was an entree salad so when did I want that to come out? If I was an owner, I would tell employees \"if people want to order 4 apps, 3 salads, 6 entrees, 5 desserts, etc please do not argue with them!\" My husband also ordered a French onion soup (which was never brought out) before his salmon dish. The apps and salads were very good. We asked for a wine bottle list and never got one. An eight top who clearly are regulars were sat after our apps came and Jackson literally only came back to deliver our entrees, we never even spoke to him again. He completely tended to the table of eight next to us. So finally a male manager came and took our second drink order and refills when our entrees were out. We again waited for our bar drinks. Our son\\'s gnocchi tasted salty and like jarred garlic. Our daughter\\'s Carbonara was good and my husband\\'s salmon was good. My veal piccata was over salted and drowning in lemon. Good cut of veal though. We ended up leaving in the middle of our meal and (drinks that by the way were brought to another table while we watched this poor waitress argue with Jackson because he insisted that they weren\\'t our drinks) because of the service. We knew we would be there all night! Ashlyn did come over and try to rectify the situation with dessert but we were looking to get out of there as it was already after 8pm and the service didn\\'t improve after we talked to the male manager. We are hopeful that our friend is not charged for this dinner. Look, we are easy to please and we love to go out to dinner. We understand that there are off nights with restaurants but we don\\'t know if it was a staffing issue or Jackson needs more training in the way he handles slightly busy nights and how he speaks to customers because we felt like a burden and an annoyance to him. (He definitely cannot be a Salesianum graduate) Many of the waitstaff seemed spread thin between the bubbles and the restaurant. I\\'m also one who leaves great reviews and bad reviews for businesses because I feel it\\'s important. Life is way too short in this Covid crazy world!', 'My husband and I had the most wonderful meal over the weekend to celebrate his birthday. The food and staff were equally amazing. Jennifer made us feel like we had known her forever.  Our meal was honestly the best and most fresh food we have had in years. The spaghetti carbonara was the best I have had since I had it in Venice ten years ago. We cannot wait to go back! Thanks for a truly amazing night', \"Was expecting more after reading the review in MainLine mag. The new decor is nicer than Angelina was now there is a full bar.\\nThe 2 artichokes were good and done well with a nice wine sauce. The vegetable tempura was quite large and came with 2 dipping sauces. The tempura was light and crispy and not at all soggy. Unfortunately the entree's were disappointing in taste. We had the pork milanese, which the waitress said had been switched to veal. Then she came back again and said no, it was going to be pork. The pork cutlets were good , but the tomato, onion topping lacked any taste. Was hoping for the arugula with shaved parm on top with a little balsamic. Place was very busy so reservations are needed , especially on a Saturday night. People were very nice and the food was fine, but not as special as we expected.\", \"Ate here on a Saturday night 5/11/2019 without a reservation but were happy to sit at the bar for dinner as it was only 2 of us.  The restaurant was packed and so was the bar.  There were 2 bartenders, the one was great, the other one was not.  So the good bartender was now picking up the slack causing him to serve a packed restaurant and bar by himself practically.  We had asked for a few things (drink, menu, check) and the bad bartender acknowledged us, but never actually brought us those things. So we had to flag the other guy down.  \\nOur food was brought out within 20 minutes of us ordering.  We had the fried calamari, baratta and a burger.  All 3 were beyond delicious.  The baratta came with a huge arugula salad on the side.  I enjoyed every single bite.  We can't wait to go back.  The decor was also beautiful, we really enjoyed our date.\", \"Food was very good! But I like a nice, casual meal, no rush... and the service was still slower than I'd like. We waited a bit too long for drinks, our appetizer, and then our to-go order (I'm pretty sure our server never entered it when we ordered, we reminded her 15 minutes later and I think that's when she put it in).  Funny thing was, it seemed like all of the servers were really rushing all night, which was a bit of a quandary since all of our service was slow.\\n\\nDrinks: my husband ordered a Moretti, and it was cold and perfect. I had their house Sauvignon Blanc, and while I enjoyed it, I felt the pour was short. Maybe it was the glass that was the issue and it was perception, but we dine out frequently, and this pour was one of the smallest in the area. \\n\\nAs for the food: First and foremost, the fritto misto (fried calamari) was the best I have ever had. Loved the sauce!\\n\\nThe Caesar salads we both ordered were big, we easily could have shared one. But they were a little too dressed, and the dressing was a bit drippy and perhaps a shade too salty. However, we ate it all :)\\n\\nMy husband had one of the specials, beef medallions. I had the grouper. He asked to sub risotto for his side (he's a good Italian!) and the server had no problem with that. His beef was DELICIOUS! Tender, perfectly cooked. My grouper was excellent, very well seasoned. However, I loved the tomato puree but needed a little more as it was a beautiful bite with the grouper but there wasn't enough to finish off the whole piece of fish. I didn't finish all the fish, so took some home in a doggie bag but there will be no puree to enjoy with the leftovers :( \\n\\nThe saffron risotto was so good. My husband was disappointed that there was not a risotto dish on the menu as an entrée. They should consider adding a regular risotto entree, as well as a risotto special of the day. \\n\\nOverall, we will definitely return and hope the service is better!\", \"We went on Saturday, for my birthday. I paid $25.00 for a dining pod, which was fun and felt pretty safe. They were having a kitchen problem so my 7:15 reservation was pushed to 7:45 (they called but we were already on our way there). The restaurant was crowded and people were standing around without masks and sitting at the bar. Once we got in the pod however it was terrible, took at least a half an hour to get a drink... then it took more than an hour and a half to get our appetizers! The waiter seemed busy but didn't really come by, no one explained it would have been that long or we would have left. So we just sat there waiting, when we got our food it was ok but almost 10:00! The restaurant didn't take anything off our bill for the wait and it wasn't cheap... I probably won't be back which is a shame because I went once for brunch and it was much better\", \"I went back to try their pork milanese. This was a hit or miss. The first time, it was tender and the breading was lightly crisp, very fresh tasting. The second time, the meat dish was dry and the breading was hard. It seems like it's been in the oven too long.\", 'Just came back from a dinner with friends and it was absolutely wonderful! Ate outside and enjoyed excellent outdoor music and a three course meal which was delicious for everyone! Great service! Highly recommend!', 'Was seated at 7 pm which was our reservation.\\n7:30 waitress took order apps came out slow\\nCheese and meet platter perfect,pear salad very good\\nMains veal and shrimp very good, baked bow tie pasta \\n(I have the noodle wrong) with meatballs very good!\\nWaitress was in over hear head and was distracted by a tabletop of apparent friend in our sections \\nHad the  provonce rose ...two cold! \\nAll in all when this place matured I think we will have a winner in Glen Mills', 'Wonderful experience!  from the check in with the host, to the very end with our dessert! Extremely accommodating on a Saturday night with no reservation. We were seated right away!  Maria our server was amazing!  Food and atmosphere very welcoming, live music was a perfect touch!\\nWe will be back!', 'We had dinner at La Fava last night and it was awesome! They repurposed a large portion of the parking lot with tables, canopies and chairs. With plenty of space between tables it was perfect. \\nFor starters we had the buratta salad and Cesar salad. Both were delicious! We then had papardelle bison bolognese and lobster ravioli. Again both were great. \\nService was excellent as always. Also note they had indoor seating but that seemed to fill up quickly with the return to 25% seating capacity.', \"Great atmosphere. Very friendly staff. Very clean and safe feeling. The bubble dinning outside is great. It's like your own private room. It's warm enough even on this freezing, windy night. They rent it to you for 2 hours which is perfect! My wife and I enjoyed it a lot. But here's the but. The food for me was bland. It lacked seasoning. Even a little S & P would of helped since there is none on the tables which i assume is for Covid reasons with different guest touching the salt and pepper shakers. Improve the taste a little and this place will be 5 stars! I Guarantee it!\", 'Walking in at 7:00pm to an empty dining room should have been a red flag. The appetizers were greasy. The meatballs tasted like the needed to be cooked longer. As for the entrees: \\n- Spaghetti Carbonara: we ordered 2 and both just tasted like the pasta water it was cooked in. The flavors were not married together. \\n- Lobster Ravioli with Shrimp: the ravioli tasted old and chewy and the shrimp had a strong fishy taste. \\n- Stuffed shells: was the special of the day; nothing to write home about. \\n- Veggie Lasagne: also, meh. \\n\\nWe accidentally broke a glass with club soda and we cleaned it up ourselves since we could not locate our server for most of the meal. She then charged us to replace the club soda! \\n\\nThe service was not great and the food followed suit. Disappointing birthday meal.', \"I have been twice now to La Fava and their have been two constants with each visit :good food and good service. I've personally had the grouper and risotto and the bison bolognese both of which excellent. Bronzino and salmon got equally good reviews from other diners in the party Regarding service, Rachel you rock. Love your bubbly personality and the passion you bring to serving your guest. Will definitely be back . PS Nice bourbon collection as well\", 'Amazing new spot which opened early February. Sat at the large luxurious bar for happy hour and had a delicious dinner and the Montepulciano house red which was perfectly dry. Dana the bartender was very friendly and helpful. The fava bean spread that comes with the bread is delightful and the meatballs were great with the lemon ricotta which made it extra special. Will come back for sure!', 'Food was amazing. Branzino done to perfection and the octopus is a must try!  Service is great too! Had a great time!', \"We were seated right away without reservations which was nice.  We ordered drinks and they took a bit to come out, the waitress seemed to have to mix her own drinks. We finally got our drinks and then had to wait another 20 minutes to order our entrees, so 30 minutes total from the time we were seated. Bread for the table didn't arrive until 40 minutes after we were seated.  It took a while for the food to come out of the kitchen.  The food was good in general but my wife's panini was slightly burnt and her fries were under cooked.  Also there is no kids menu so we had to buy a full entree for our daughter who ate only a small portion of it.  Restaurant also got quite loud making it difficult to have a conversation with those seated across from you.  We may go back bit it won't be our first choice.\", 'I really loved the lunch buffet. Loved my waitress too. The food is fresh and the place is pretty inside. So far only did the buffet but was very pleased.', 'Interesting restaurant .  Menu is Italian centric hard call about the ambiance since we sat in a make shift dining room in the parking lot.   We tried the fried calamari, shrimp cocktail, house Cesar salad, and cannalini with broccoli rabe, and the house burata cheese with strawberry watermelon and balsamic.   The beans and rabe were bland needed a bit of salt but Flavor was there .   The burata cheese app was good but the watermelon was tasteless.   The other apps were solid.   One of our guests did say the cocktail sauce was a bit on the sweet side and had a fruit note.   We had the Norwegian salmon , chicken parm, gnocchi mushroom and sausage, one filet mignon all meals were cooked well.   The chicken parm was basic and standard.   The gnocchi was just \"ok\" .   The steak was cooked a bit too well for what was asked .  The salmon was good .   Overall the meal was good .   Price was 300.00 which is about standard for 5 people and 4 drinks.   Not a bad choice but there are definitely some competition nearby.   We were celebrating a birthday so the birthday boy was happy which is most important .   GPS this place off way to get in to shopping center .', 'My wife and parents came here for dinner tonight (sunday). Our experience was absolutely amazing! Not only was the food great but the service was above and beyond. From our server Jessica to the busser/runner. From the top down! Every staff memeber we came in contact with was happy to be there. Coming from a restaurant manager myself, I would recommend La Fava over and over. We will 100% be back.', \"Went on New Year's Eve around 6:30- made the reservation for regular seating, was pushed into high top. Husband got knocked into several times, we were all so packed in. Food was bland, portions small, lentil soup had about 5 lentil beans in it. Even the table next to us asked for salt shaker. Bill was outrageous. Noise level off the chart. One and done.\", \"Apologies to La Fava - - this review is long overdue. Way back on September 21st my family gathered there to celebrate a daughter's Birthday - - and I'm just now getting around to submitting my comments. and they are all good. Food was great, staff excellent, and the attention to our needs, awesome. We were 6 adults and and 3 children seated at a large table @5:30 pm. As the sun set and the light started streaming through the large West windows, it was blinding to several seated at the table (I should mention the restaurant was newly opened, and all the curtains had not been hung). The staff, led by manager Michael Buono took great pains - and ladders - to hang tablecloths to shield our table, moving them several times till the setting sun was no longer a factor. We appreciate all your attention, and will be back this holiday season!\", \"We had my daughter's Bridal Shower there.  The staff was wonderful about following Covid-19 rules, as was our small group of 16.  The food was delicious, service was impeccable!  We started with the arugula salad, followed by a pasta course of orecchiette, then an entree choice of chicken piccata or norwegian salmon.  Dessert was cannoli and Italian cookies.  We found their price per person for this afternoon event was less than the usual Chester County venues. They went out of their way to make my daughter's day special and memorable for all.  I would recommend LaFava for anyone planning an event, or just in the mood for a good meal!\", 'Had the Bolognese pasta definitely not the best. \\nMy friends had the chicken Parm and it was so good. Nice place. Burrata dish was tasty.', 'Arrived at 5:45 for a party of two on a Wednesday evening. We were kindly greeted and seated right away without a reservation. We had assistance ordering a bottle of wine to go with our meal (we are not wine connoisseurs) from the manager and our waitress, Rachel, was kind and attentive.\\n\\nWe ordered the:\\nEggplant rollatini (app special)...delicious! I love eggplant. It was so cheesy and the sauce was really flavorful.\\nMonkfish- great portion of fish over large serving of risotto. Served hot and yummy \\nSoft shell crab special- crispy and cooked perfect. Got cold fast and could have used a little spice but was great.\\n\\nWe did not have room for dessert but will be back!', \"La Fava has hosted us for our last three Thanksgivings. We've also visited several other times. \\n\\nI love the large menu and drink list. The staff is always professional, friendly and often funny. \\n\\nOf course this thanksgiving (2020) was a little different but la fava stepped up with the outdoor seating. The host checked on us to make sure we were comfortable.\\n\\nI HIGHLY recommend the strawberry flambé for dessert.\", \"Delicious and cute outdoor spot! A little on the high end price wise but worth it. Yummy food and great wine and cocktail options. Came here for Father's Day and everyone enjoyed themselves.\", \"I really wish I took a picture of the menu! La Fava just recently opened and a welcome addition to the neighborhood! Maggie was our server and she was great. They didn't have a spicy margarita on the menu, so I asked and they accommodated. It was super spicy but the sugar rim balanced it out just right. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer. This was the first time I have ever had fried shrimp come out with the fried calamari. I absolutely loved that they did that. For my main course I had the seafood stew. It was good. I would give it a 3.5/5. They do their bananas foster dessert tableside, so of course we had to get it. Who doesn't like a little flambé action? It was a good dessert, but I enjoyed the prep more than the actual dessert. The owner/manager was super friendly. I think he went to every table to greet each person which was so nice to see. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves and will be back!\", 'So glad we chose to go to La Fava.  The food was delicious.  The grilled octopus was an incredible app and the chicken parmesan was perfect.  The service was excellent as was our conversation with the owner, Michael.  We will be back and will bring friends!', 'While the atmosphere here is inviting, the food left something to be desired. The entrees had little to no flavor (rigatoni norma, chicken Parmesan, steak). The pasta tasted like it was from a box with jarred sauce poured on top. The service was friendly and accommodating, but the meal took close to an hour to come out. All in all, I will not return.', \"I really wanted the third time to be the charm. It wasn't. My first experience there was great. Nice waitress, great food. I have been back twice. Last night was the last. Unfortunately. \\nI really wanted to like it. First, it is extremely expensive for the food that you're given. The veal osso buco was $38.00, the spinach gnocchi was $21.00. Nothing special. Second, portions are small and the hot appetizers were warm to cold. Third, the wait staff should learn to keep snarky comments about what you order to themselves. I don't need to hear color commentary about the food or drinks I decide to order. So disappointed.\", 'Everything about this place is quality. Stopped in for happy hour with John. We were a group of 6 and sat at the bar. The owner Michael has an outstanding personality and walked around to make sure everything was perfect.  Apps we had the cheese and meat tray, eggplant and calamari all were perfect. Dinner we had the gnocchi boscaiola, salmon with spinach and potato and the chicken rosmarino. Wow absolutely amazing food and big portions. Highly recommend.', 'Our experience was wonderful! Love the covid bubble outside dining, made us feel safe even during the pandemic. Will definitely be back soon!', 'Lovely meal with wonderful service. Delicious cocktails- great old fashioned!! Tomahawk steak was amazing, delicious and well presented.', 'Four of us went this past Saturday night and really enjoyed our experience.  Drinks were good and our meals were delicious.  We started with their grilled octopus and fried calamari appetizer.  Both were delicious and the octopus was really tender.  Our main entrees included gnocchi (homemade and very light), eggplant (norma) and pasta and roasted pork.  Only items lacking was the taste of my cappuccino...I truly think they forgot the coffee portion of the drink.   But overall, we all enjoyed our dishes and said it was a definite return again restaurant.  Thanks La Fava!', \"Really yummy food and a nice atmosphere. The food had a high price point for what you were served (about 3-5 dollars above west Chester borough prices). However, the food was delicious and the service was friendly and attentive. \\n\\nWe had the burrata to start, which is some of the best I've had since being in Italy. \\n\\nWe all got either the branzino or salmon for dinner both of which was really tasty. My salmon was in a fairly bland sauce and a little overcooked, but overall decent flavor. The branzino was really nicely prepared. We had some brocollini on the side which was swimming in oil, but it has a nice garlicky flavor. \\n\\nOverall fine food, and the friendliest of service. We will be sure to return to explore other menu options.\", 'Great food and great service by Vincenzo but the food was very slow.  Drink order were messed up and the owner Michael did not even Comp us a drink or dessert on a $400 bill after mentioning our 2 hour wait on a Birthday dinner', \"Owner never there. Servers trash talk thinking we cant hear them. Service was fast, but the meatballs and bread will break your teeth. I know 3 more places that have better quality food at a reasonable price. We all know how much chicken cost. Plus it's a copy menu of down the street.\", \"La Fava is a must try spot! Chef Laurent Cooks up wonderful and flavorful dishes! The Staff is always pleasant and the Owner touches every table to check in to see how everything is going! The after dinner cocktails are a must try! If you haven't checked it out yet don't wait! The live music on the weekends is such a nice touch!\", '3.5, but yelp doesn\\'t give that option.  Gnocchi was tasty.  Nice Cesar salad, but there is no option for a side \"green salad\" that could be considered a bit more of a healthier option.  I came here to try wine.  Wine list is pretty limited considering Wine Bar is in the name.  No flight options.  Tried the Le Fonti Chianti (3.5) and the Silver Totem WA Cab (3.).  Service was good.  It was pretty empty, but it was a Monday night at a new restaurant.', \"Would rate 0 if possible. Never had an experience like this in my life. \\ngirls night out. 6 women, 5 healthcare workers who were elbow deep in COVID for months and truly busy and overworked due to coworkers getting sick. I tell you this because we were looking for a nice relaxing night out to celebrate my birthday. \\nFrom the moment we entered i felt like thet really didn't care if we were there or not. Our waitress started her introduction by saying I am sorry but I am really busy. Really? I can tell you about be busy. Do you think I could tell a patient sorry but I am really busy. never got to try the food because after two hours our food still wasn't served so we complained. Lol they could not have cared less. No manager came over to see why we unhappy. It was an epic fail on the part of this uppity restaurant. \\nAfter leaving a place that could care less about us we ended up going to the Towne House in Media because we were starving. They were so welcoming and provided superior service. My recommendation would be to skip LaFava and go straight to the Towne House.\", 'The Owner is a great person. The place is beautiful and very warming. Is a decent place to visit after church or at any time.', \"MANAGER SHOWED NO CONCERN FOR US AND JUST WANTED OUR MONEY! It's Thanksgiving night at 10:30 pm and my wife just got out of surgery. I'm very disappointed with the managers customer service at La Fava because he showed no concern for our family. We were unable to celebrate Thanksgiving dinner at La Fava because my wife had an emergency related to surgeries she had on 11/14 and 11/16 at Howard County General Hospital. I called to cancel my reservation at 9 AM, as early as possible today and finally reached someone at 10:20 am after several calls. The hostess politely said there should be no problem canceling since this was an unavoidable emergency but the manager said we had to pay $140 to cancel and showed no compassion for our situation. He even said they had a high demand for reservations! This was his reason charging us $140, because he had held that spot for us. I guess he was saying they didn't expect many customers and needed to make as much money as possible tonight. Considering the reviews I would be surprised if business was so bad! I paid the $140 and the manager earned some great negative advertising from our family members.\", '7:30 reservation on Friday night. Arrived to check in 4 minutes early. Told \" please have a seat outside and we\\'ll seat you when your reservation time arrives\"!!!  20 minutes later we were seated.  20 minutes after that someone said hello. 20 minutes after that we had a glass of wine. 20 minutes after that, some bread and spread. The Dover Sole \"looked \" tasty, but at $49 I passed. Think I will keep on passing.  ( il Graneo, Pescatories, Arrugula, Taverna, Bardea, etc. )', \"Our first visit to La Fava about a week ago was for takeout appetizers because we had a gift card and didn't care for many of the dinner entrees.  Today, we returned for brunch (if you want to call it that) to use the remainder of the card. There was very little to choose from in terms of selections, but that wasn't the main problem. His breakfast taco arrived without eggs or avocado but a generous portion of chicken. My avocado toast was made as requested but I would have liked an option for other toast instead of a thick roll that was hard to eat or cut with the steak knife offered and at least ground pepper on the table. The clincher was the only option for water was 4.00 a bottle! Really? My tea was half the cost.  The server said the bottled water was as per CDC guidelines, but I have been to plenty of restaurants lately that have given free tap water. My husband didn't want to say anything about his food because we still had a gift card balance to use, even though we went over with the $4.00 per bottle water. Also, he just wanted to get out without any additional wait. \\n\\nNot that we were interested, but they offer their outdoor dining for an additional fee. When other places are hurting for business, I guess they just don't care.\\n\\nNeedless to say, we won't be back.\", 'Love the outdoor vibe. Happy hour is fun. Live music was a surprise. Food was delicious. Definitely going back.', \"I'll give La Fava a 5 star for our Saturday Night dinner. We do love this Italian restaurant, the flavors are a bit different than some of the other great Italian restaurants in Delco. We had a party of 4 for a very busy Saturday 7 pm reservation. The bar was packed, 3 deep in some spots and there was a private party with a band in their banquet room. We were greeted by name, welcomed back by the hostess and seated immediately. We ate with a client and his wife, who my wife had not met so we were not in any rush. Within a few minutes we were greeted by Edwardo, a very nice server we have had before. He's good, and we will request him next time. He went over the menu, talked about a few specials (36 Oz tomahawk steak for 2 !!) brought water and returned in a minute to get our drink order. There is an extensive wine list and some special cocktails on the menu. We ordered a round of drinks and relaxed. The place was packed every table was full, and people coming in. A little loud but expected for a Saturday. A testament to their food and commitment to service. I ate there the first week they opened, it was empty but you knew the food would bring the people. Drinks arrived after a few minutes we asked Edwardo for a few minutes to decide on the food choices. He was busy and I'm sure he was glad to accommodate. In the meantime the owner Mike came to meet us and welcome us back. He was busy but took his time to talk to our guests, who live nearby but never ate there. Bread and oil/hummus/pesto arrived. \\nFinally time to order. Apps were the grilled crab cake, large and full of crab. I ordered the eggplant rolatini, perfectly prepared with tasty gravy and cheese. The soup special was a bean and ham purée. Delicious. And the house salad which is enough for two. Every plate was completely cleaned.  For dinner we ordered a combination of menus and specials. I ordered the home made butter nut squash raviolis in a creamy cheese sauce. 6 nice size raviolis perfectly cooked and with a tasty but not overpowering sauce. My wife ordered the chicken parm which was large and came with homemade pasta. Enough for lunch today!! Our guests ordered a gluten free penne and spinach dish with red gravy and the bronzino fileted Table side. We ate everything. We did see a few tomahawk steaks served they were massive. Next time! \\nDinners were all shared some so we could taste everything. All agreed the dishes were great and all had distinct taste.  We saw the banana foster being prepared table side and had to order that for two and our guests shared the creme Brulé. With espresso and a couple after dinner cocktails turned into a perfect evening we sat until close to 10 so perfectly paced for us. La Fava has obviously been discovered. Try it you will be hooked quickly. With apps dinner 3 drinks each meal and dessert we came in at $80 a head before a generous tip. And an easy Uber ride home. \\n\\n\\nTaste.\", 'Simply put.   Way too expensive for what we received!  We havent been going to restaurants because of the pandemic.   We only went that night because our power was out and the house was dark and hot.\\nSo disappointing.     It was our first and last visit.', 'Open tables outside with umbrellas, music, lights with garden flowers and vegetables bordering all around eating area. I was glad to learn the first class service and food is delivered outside just as it is sitting in. So glad to get out of the house and enjoy eating out again!!!', \"On a Saturday night, we wanted to have a nice dinner with our family of 10 total.  We were seated a little later than our reservation which wasn't a major issue but once seated, we had to wait for over an hour and a half to get our order.  The food was very good with good presentation but even the best of meals could not overcome our wait time.  \\n\\nI'm sure that the service is likely better during the week but our Saturday night experience was awful.  Lastly, it was so loud that it was hard to hear anyone else at our table causing us to only have conversations with the person seated next to us.\", 'I am a wedding officiant and had just married a couple at a venue in Chadds Ford.  Following the ceremony, I realized how hungry I was so I decided to stop somewhere on my way back home.  I made a quick reservation at La Fava since it was a Saturday evening.  The staff was excellent and the food was very good but very overpriced.  I had the veal marsala which was almost $30.  After reviewing their menu, I realized that these are the types of prices you would find in Center City restaurants.  I am not complaining, but merely pointing out an observation.', 'La Fava in Glen Mills for the win Sunday evening! All safety practices in place and delicious food with excellent service. We chose to dine outside since it was such a beautiful night. Good live music and dog friendly. My only negative is the hand sanitizer they provided - too sticky!', \"So good!!! Best meatballs I've ever had!! As another review mentioned, it was difficult to hear, but we were there on Mother's Day and there were many large groups. We'll be back for sure!\", 'Went to happy hour on Friday. Excellent service, nice comfortable atmosphere in the bar. Appetizers were delicious, especially the clams. Will return often.', \"Great to find this hidden jewel! I was looking for somewhere for our family to have brunch and most of our usual options were fully booked. Fortunately I stumbled on La Fava on Yelp! We had a fantastic time - great food, good relaxed ambiance and great service from Alex. I could even take a sneak peep at the Euros on the big screen behind the bar. We will definitely be returning after last Sunday's experience. I would encourage others to visit and support La Fava - we will definitely be going back for brunch, dinner and happy hour!\", 'What a Great restaurant ! Love  it\\nSuper Friendly service\\n delicious food great atmosphere! \\nTry the flatbread with short Ribs awesome.', \"Might be a Covid lack of employees issue, but the service last night was horrible.  Can't really blame the server (although she did break 3 glasses because she was running around so fast).  Took 20 mins for someone to come to our table after we were seated, then another 30 mins to get our meal.  Food was good, but they are lacking servers for sure.  The hostess was busy doing other jobs as well.  She seems a bit snooty too, but could just be me.  The outdoor seating was not even half full.  Have to imagine they weren't taking reservations because they didn't have the staff.  Not sure.  We had a most pleasant experience when they had the heated bubbles in the winter, but likely won't be back for awhile until they can figure out staffing.  It's a shame because we do like it there.  Someday we'll get to sit at the bar.  Haven't been able to in years because it's either always crowded or now because of Covid.  Dang Covid.\", 'This was our first time dining at La Fava and we loved it. Everything was great! The food was excellent, plated nicely, and good sized portions. Our server was very attentive. The owner was walking around checking on tables. He also made our banana foster dessert. This is definitely a gem! We will return for sure!', 'We were able to get outdoor seating without a reservation on a Thursday night. The fava dip was amazing. There was some nice live music- a solo guitarist. Our waiter was extremely polite and pleasant. We had insalata misto with a nice touch of fennel. My husband had the eggplant parm as an entree with spaghetti. I had the salmon with beans which really hit the spot.', 'It is a relaxing & classy environment with good service & awesome food.\\nFrom start to finish was excellent, our hard to please group PLEASED:).', 'Probably the best Italian restaurant in Delaware County. Go there.', 'The best spot in town! With some of the best Italian/Mediterranean food around! Such a wonderful atmosphere to eat in, excellent service, great management, and the food and drinks are made with perfection! Definitely a place you need to try!', \"The experience started out okay, but it ended awfully. We came in on a Sunday for brunch and the service was initially prompt and delightful. Our drinks came out quickly and the margarita was yummy. We ordered and then, we waited. And we waited. And we waited. There were some tables outside, but the restaurant inside was empty other than a few people at the bar. They were having a private event in another room, but the group had moved on to dessert. We couldn't figure out why it was taking so long, and our server didn't stop by our table once to explain or apologize for the delay (despite walking past us multiple times). \\n\\nOver an hour after we'd been seated, we finally received our order. It was a disaster. Two members of the party had ordered eggs Benedict. One of them came out without Canadian bacon. The poached eggs were significantly over cooked. The hollandaise was dried up and not appetizing. Myself and another had ordered the burgers. The menu description was fontina, smoked tomato jam, spinach pesto, on a brioche bun. The burger came out on dry Texas toast, no jam, no pesto and it was burnt on the outside to the point it was inedible. It tasted like an ashtray. I am not usually one to complain, and I was very hungry--but this was just such a mess I couldn't even power through it. We each took a few bites and asked for our check immediately. They comped our meal and we just paid for the drinks, which was seriously the least they could do at this point. \\n\\nThey were very apologetic and I understand what a struggle the service and hospitality industry is going through with the pandemic. I would normally cut them some slack in my review. The part that was inexcusable in this situation was that the server didn't ever stop by to let us know about the struggles in the kitchen. It wasn't that busy. The hosts/managers were standing around a lot. Someone could've spoken to us. They could've done so many things to salvage our experience. If they'd brought us an appetizer or offered to let us order something different off the menu since our original order was not available as described, this would be a different review. If when the server brought the food out, she'd explained what had changed with the burgers, this would be a different review. But other than her saying that their bread delivery didn't show up, there was no mention that it was seriously modified from the menu description. It's on her that she didn't evaluate the quality or apologize for the fact that it wasn't really what we ordered. \\n\\nThey asked us to come back and give them another chance (this would've been a great time to offer us a gift card if they were really trying to earn our business back)--but since this was one of the most disappointing dining experiences of my life, I can assure you I won't be returning.\", 'The first time I went here, food, service was excellent. Then, things went downhill. The complimentary bread I had on my last visit was old and stale. I told the waitress, and she almost argued with me but she didnt. She brought out another type of bread, which wasnt quite as stale. It didnt have the fresh bread taste when I first went there. The fish dish that I ordered was very good. This restaurant is not a quiet restaurant because you got people drinking at the bar who can get loud. Because this is a new restaurant, the service needs to to improve a bit. I remember coming in one day and was going to order some food. No one was at the front. I can see the owner or manager talking to friends at the bar, but no one came by to say, can I help you. So after waiting awhile, I just walked out. I really do want to like this new restaurant. It has a good chef.', 'Seemed ok. Portions very small. The veal and shrimp dish was was over priced with 2 small sized pieces of veal and 3 tiny shrimp for $29.00\\nNothing special but we tried it once. \\nLarge cafeteria style dining room . \\nGreat service but at the prices they want and the value and quality was not there.', 'Awesome food great atmosphere, great wines. Service was excellent. We ate inside and tables were spaced nicely. They also have outdoor pods which looked fun.  We were their Saturday night and the place was filled wit positive energy.', 'Had a great meal at La Fava tonight! We will be back! Everything was delicious and our server Hailey was fabulous!!', 'Anyone else who had their Christmas Eve plans go awry at this unmitigated disaster last night will surely agree. I hope they share. As I was leaving one hour after our reservation time, a woman was furiously speaking to one of the hostess about her 90 minute wait after reservation time. People waiting hours after their reservation time to be seated. Pure poor planning and greed of overbooking. The hostess playing busboy setting clean dishes in between the ones left by the last patrons. at this point, you have to wonder what the kitchen standards are. We walked out and had a delicious dinner at the always consistent Concordville Inn. So glad they had room for us', \"La Fava hosted my daughter's Bridal Shower on Saturday, September 19th. \\nEverything was perfection. The food was spectacular, the service was impeccable. \\nThe Restaurant Manager, Ashlyn Hoover was so on top of her game during the planning down to the day of the event. \\n\\nI highly recommend La Fava Restaurant and Bar for your next event. \\nThey follow all CDC protocols and government regulations during this time.\", 'When I called to make a reservation, I was told that it cost $50 to hold our reservation to dine in an outdoor igloo.  I was also told that the charge would be applied toward our bill. However, at the end of the meal, I was surprised when the the bill listed a $50 service charge.  The way the host described the $50 charge, I thought it was a holding fee that would be applied as a credit to the bill total. I wish that the $50 service charge had been clearly communicated up front.', 'So this was our second time. First time we sat at bar and had a very nice experience. They had just opened and ordered appetizers and drinks. So decided to go back for whole dinner experience. First off, service was excellent. Everyone is very friendly and engaged. Server made suggestions and was very attentive. The menu has a variety and makes it hard to decide what you want (a good thing). We tried the cheese board. Very good (suggest maybe adding some type of bread/cracker with it). Had Caesar-I enjoyed but husband not a fan as he thought anchovy taste too much. Husband had gnocchi dish he really liked. Here is where they lost me. I had a seafood dish and I am pretty confident the seafood not fresh. Calamari looked awful, yellowish, rubber and large rings that were very uniform in shape and size. I think may be some type of frozen stuff. Mussels and clams tasted off and shrimp dried out. No flavor in sauce either -super disappointing especially considering almost $30 for dish. Top it off their wines by the glass not great either-tastes were funny as well and temperature warm (white). The prices are on the high end and hence my expectations which were not met with the entree and drinks.', \"I've been here three time so far. Every time was great. We really like the calamari appetizer. I too a friend who generally doesn't like calamari, and he thought it was very good. \\n\\nThey have a nice decor and friendly servers. Literally every food item I tried was very good. I especially liked the pork chop.\", \"Sat night. Crowded and loud. Bread was good, thankfully, because that is the only thing brought to our table for the first 1:15 hours. \\n\\nReservation at 7:15, got home at 9:10 without eating. 70+  Inlaws just couldn't bear it anymore. \\nWe were starving and three full glasses of water didnt do it. \\n\\nPoorly staffed and prepared.

Il Graneo,  Arrugala.\", \"Came here shortly before everything shut down due to COVID and loved it! The wine selection is stellar and the food was fabulous.\\n\\nWhy only 3 stars then, you ask? We waited almost an hour past our reservation time and kept being told it would only be 15 more minutes. It was already on the late side (maybe 9pm) and the bar was packed, so we stood the entire time waiting. Additionally, the waitress was friendly in an overbearing way. She wouldn't take no for an answer when we didn't want something and we had to ask her to leave us alone. Friendly woman, but she was annoying if I'm being honest. We both groaned when she would walk toward us.\\n\\nI'd come back and give it another shot someday as the salmon was incredible and again, the wine selection is absurdly large and high quality. The inside is quite nice as well, I hope we have a better service experience next time.\", \"Brand new. 3 weeks old. A different menu. Non traditional. No veal parmagian for example. Serving size are good. We found the the gnocchi and monk fish a tad salty but then we don't use salt at all so we might be too sensitive. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. They are trying hard.\", 'The food was good. Our service was pretty bad.  Sodas were flat from sitting with ice in at the bar while waiting to be delivered to our table. We ordered an appetizer which never arrived and then once we mentioned that it should be taken off the bill someone brought it to our table and said \"we\\'ve been really backed up\".', 'I made a reservation to sit outside in the pods. The hostess was rude and cursing at the computer. Apparently we weren\\'t able to sit in the pods because it was too close to dinner service, but eventually \"squeezed us in\". The service was slow, had to pay for water, and the food wasn\\'t good. I won\\'t be going back.', \"La Fava - Glen Mills.  Don't let the strip mall location scare you.    We were delighted with complimentary bread with springy and palate-pleasing dollop of fava bean puree. We ordered the Truffled Mac N Cheese, Octopus, Calamari,   Eggplant Parmesan Stack and Wildberry Sorbetto.  All of which were extremely delicious.  I did ask for no truffle on the Mac N Cheese since I knew my son wouldn't like it (and he refused to eat it) so that was the one low point of the meal (although the rest of us thought it was delicious and didn't send it back but just took it home to eat later) .  My extremely picky shrunken human surprised me by devouring my plate of  octopus.... so we ordered another one which he also mostly gobbled up!  The outside seating is quite lovely, with nice big red umbrellas, huge brightly   colored potted flowers and string lights which make for a romantic evening.  I don't know why I am just hearing about this place now. Such a fantastic meal and loved their outside set-up!\", \"Great spot . Really close to my Mom's retirement community! \\nThe special touches are great.  The service was lovely.\\nThe portions were quite big!  Would definitely recommend it.\", 'This was where we stopped for an early supper after spending the afternoon at Longwood Gardens. It was our first time there. There were appropriate private COVID precautions in place and all servers wore masks.  We ordered the roasted fingerling potatoes for an app. They were very good!  Some sort of dipping sauce might have made the perfect. My hubby had the salmon and said it was delicious and cooked perfectly. I had the ricotta gnocchi w/o sausage. Also delicious. We enjoyed this place and will be back.', \"My wife and I went on a Saturday night. It was very busy so we were glad that we had made a reservation. It was crowded and loud which is to be expected on a Saturday night in this area. Plus the business is still relatively new, so they still have that new place pull. The tables were too close together so it was irritating to be listening to others conversations. The food was good, the wine was good. I found it a little pricey for the experience. I don't think I will return because for the money I believe better food and experiences can be easily found.\", 'Went there Saturday the 10th of August, for the first time. What a pleasant experience. The food was awesome, the service was on point. Loved the interior. This is a restaurant that I will be going back to.', \"Won't go again. Slow service. We waited almost 1/2 hour for drinks and appetizers. Food was ok. Not worth the trip.\", \"This is a hard review for me. See, I hated my entree but I enjoyed some other things and my husband loved his entree. So I hope I can be fair and give you an idea if this is the place for you. First off we got 2 servings of onion soup. Price was $18 for the two. The soup was flavorful but sweet. If you enjoy that hot bubbly cheese with your onion soup? No..your not going to get it. They use very little cheese. It was still good. We also shared a meatball app, about $13. The meatballs tasted good but the texture was a bit mushy and fell apart as soon as the fork touched it. I had chicken parm with a small serving of pasta. The chicken parm was crispy and the pasta al dente however the flavor was odd. The whole plate tasted like citrus. I literally tasted a lemony aftertaste from both the chicken and pasta. I can only assume it was from the sauce? I asked the waiter and he said it was from the tomatoes? Idk but it was the worst I had. The hubs had veal picatta with asparagus and cheesy potatoes. He really enjoyed his plate. Dessert was fine , we had a slice of cheesecake and 3 mini canolli's. Service was excellent. The owner or manager ( not sure which) was constantly looking around and staying attentive which we appreciate...shows someone cares about the business. So, not my cup of tea but may be yours! They have a great wine selection and nice Monday night specials. The place has a quaint atmosphere which makes it a good date night place. My advice? If your looking for TRADITIONAL Italian I would not come here. If your willing to twist things up maybe have drinks and a few apps? Willing to try something a bit different but with a Familiar feel? Give it a try.\", 'What a fabulous night.  Our waitress Alessia was amazing.  Our service was the best we have had!!!  Alison Landon, the performer for the night, was fabulous! Highly recommend!!!', \"Always in the mood for some good Italian food!\\n\\nThe food was EXCELLENT .... the experience wasn't. Main dining room was like a banquet hall & VERY loud. Decor was sparse and nothing special.  The service was TERRIBLE.... waited 30 minutes after appetizers to get dinner for 2 people. Waiter & bossman kept coming over to apologize... not coming back !\", 'Unfortunately I was very disappointed with the whole thing.  You can\\'t control mother nature...I get it.  But if you can\\'t give us seats where your feet aren\\'t in a puddle  and you aren\\'t getting dripped on, then maybe waive the \"no cancel\" fee.  The food was bland and there wasn\\'t much of it.  Four ravioli\\'s for $27?  I was sick to stomach paying the bill.  First dinner out in six months to celebrate a special occasion.  The staff did the best they could...they aren\\'t making the food or setting the prices.  I will not be back again.', \"This place is amazing...and, I'm picky!  The octopus appetizer is so flavorful.  The gnocchi is light but balanced and warmed by the sausage and mushrooms.  We had the osso bucco special and the meat was falling off the bone. The lobster ravioli had beautiful bits of roasted garlic throughout.  It was a perfect birthday dinner. Thanks\", 'OK. In the interest of fairness, we have never had a bad meal at La Fava. We were annoyed at the lack of service, but not at the servers. I guess this was a case of not being able to get enough servers. Still, there was a wedding reception in the private room, so maybe they should have cut back on the reservations. Fond memories of dining in La Fava bubbles this winter. We may try again.', \"This is the first time ever leaving a review. \\nI made reservations to celebrate my daughters birthday for 12 people . I made a comment in the special notes box explaining that my daughter is a newlywed and this will be the first celebration that we're having with both sides of the family since the wedding. I called the next day to make sure they got the reservation and understood how special it is. \\nThat was a few weeks ago. Today - less than a week before the reservation they called me to cancel  . Their explanation was that there was a computer glitch and the restaurant is having a private event!!\\nThey offered another night(NO- Thursday is her birthday!!) They offered a champagne toast to make it right( are you kidding me!) \\nThis was wrong and is ruining the celebration. What are the chances that we find another restaurant to accommodate this many people, with such short notice?\\nAs I said,THIS IS WRONG!!\", \"Went for brunch on a Sat. One of the first patrons in the restaurant. Service was a bit slow considering they weren't busy. We sat outside on a beautiful day however, bees were constantly bothering us. Food was very good. All enjoyed salads eggs Benedict etc.   Willing to go back under different conditions.\", \"First I want to say that I am very lenient on restaurants esp in covid. My family has a restaurant for 38 year's so I completely understand the ins and outs of a restaurant. I wanted to take my mom out for Mother's Day. They made me give them my credit card when I called to insure that I would show up. If I canceled within the 4 days they were going to charge me $25 per person. \\nI had a reservation for 5:15. When I got there at 5....they were overwhelmed and things seemed a mess. When I finally got assisted by the hostess after 10 min, she told me it would be $185 for a party of 3. I had NO idea it was a buffet...esp in covid I was a bit taken aback. She told me it was on their website but I only went on Yelp and looked at their menu there. Plus, when I spoke to a person on the phone, no one told me it was a buffet. So after that, they told me it would be about 20 min. Ok fine. So I went into the bar area and stood and watched. There were so many tables dirty and 3 in particular that were already set up. No one was seated in the 20 min I stood there. There must have been 30 people outside waiting to be seated. They were extremely disorganized. I finally pressured someone to seat us....considering I watched all those empty tables for over 20 min!! Plus the fact, they don't have servers, so I didn't understand the hold up. \\nNow the food....I would say, it was just ok. Nothing to rave about and definitely not $60 per person! It was a shame. I wanted to take my mom out to a really nice restaurant (since she spends her time at her own restaurant 7 days a week) I was very disappointed to say the least. I even called yesterday and left a message so I could just speak to someone about this but no one returned my phone call. Oh well. They will not see us back again.\", 'My husband And I went for dinner last night and it was really fantastic. We have driven by La Fava for years and finally decided to give it a try and we were not disappointed! I wish we tried this place a long time ago. We sat at a table near the bar and it was perfect. The decor and the bar setup was really nice. We got there before 6 so we took advantage of the happy hour drinks and apps. It was a great deal! My husband said his Old Fashion was the best he ever had. The apps were delicious as well. We ordered entrees and they were also top notch. We really enjoyed our evening and felt the food and the service were excellent. We will definitely be back!', 'This place is a goof place for happy hour. Everyone is friendly and the food is good!']\n"
